# Craft Your World Website
This will eventually be the website for Craft Your World. This is still considered to be in a semi-closed alpha. Once everything everything works without too many hitches and we officially enter beta, we plan to switch to a custom domain. If we're unable to get a custom domain, we'll use the default Github Pages domain.  
There is still a lot of work to do. The site doesn't have a working pack picker yet. Nor does it work on smaller devices. If you'd like, you can contribut to reduce the time to beta or release.
